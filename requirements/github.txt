# Python libraries to install directly from github
# 
# A correct GitHub reference looks like this:
#
#   git+https://github.com/OWNER/REPO-NAME.git@TAG-OR-SHA#egg=KIT-NAME==VERSION
#
# For example:
#
#   git+https://github.com/example/example-lint.git@v0.3.2#egg=example_lint==0.3.2
#
# where:
#
#   OWNER = example
#   REPO-NAME = example-lint
#   TAG-OR-SHA = v0.3.2
#   KIT-NAME = example_lint
#   VERSION = 0.3.2
#
#
# Rules to follow (even though many URLs here don't follow them!):
#
#   * Don't leave out any of these pieces.
#
#   * Don't use -e
#
#   * TAG-OR-SHA must be a git tag, or a git SHA.  Don't use branch names here.
#
#   * KIT-NAME might be different than REPO-NAME.  KIT-NAME must be the same as
#     the `name="KIT-NAME"` value in the repo's setup.py.
#
#   * VERSION might not be the same as TAG-OR-SHA, but if the tag names the
#     version, please make it match the VERSION, but with a "v" prefix.
#     VERSION must be the same as the `version="VERSION"` value in the repo's
#     setup.py.  An alternative is to use 0.0 as VERSION: this forces pip to
#     re-install the package each time, and can be useful when working with two
#     repos before picking a version number. Don't use 0.0 on master, only for
#     tight-loop work in progress.
